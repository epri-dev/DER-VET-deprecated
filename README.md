# DER-VET™

[DER-VET™](https://der-vet.com) provides a free, publicly accessible, open-source platform for calculating, understanding, and optimizing the value
of distributed
energy resources (DER) based on their technical merits and constraints. An extension of EPRI's [StorageVET®](./storagevet) tool, DER-VET supports
site-specific assessments of energy storage and additional DER technologies—including solar, wind, demand response, electric vehicle charging,
internal combustion engines, and combined heat and power—in different configurations, such as microgrids. It uses load and other data to determine
optimal size, duration, and other characteristics for maximizing benefits based on site conditions and the value that can be extracted from targeted
use cases. Customers, developers, utilities, and regulators across the industry can apply this tool to inform project-level decisions based on sound
technical understanding and unbiased cost-performance data.

DER-VET was developed with funding from the California Energy Commission. EPRI plans to support continuing updates and enhancements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for
notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### New Installation

Follow these steps to run DER-VET through your command line on your local computer.

1. #### Clone/download this repository onto your local computer.
    When cloning a repo with 'git clone', if you do not specify a new directory as the last argument, it will be named
   `DER-VET`. Alternatively, you can specify this and name it as you please. Regardless of what the downloaded folder is
   named or located, this new directory becomes the 'root directory' of dervet.

    >The *root directory* refers to the folder with folders/files such as
   > `dervet`, `data`, `test`, `README.md` (this file), `Model_Parameters_Template_DER.csv`, and `run_DERVET.py`.

2. #### Clone/download the sub-repository, [StorageVET](https://github.com/epri-dev/StorageVET), onto your local computer in the *root directory* as `storagevet`.

3. #### Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for python 3.**
   >It is recommended for Windows users to install and use Anaconda.

4. #### Install system requirements
    **On Windows**
    Install the Build Tools for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). When prompted by the
    installer, select C++ build tools and the appropriate Windows SDK specified in the table below and install.

    | Windows OS   | SDK        |
    |--------------|------------|
    | Windows 7    | Windows 8.1|
    | Windows 8.1  | Windows 8.1|
    | Windows 10   | Windows 10 |

   **On Mac**

    Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [GLPK](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/glpk)

5. #### Open Anaconda Prompt
    or a corresponding shell/terminal/console/prompt, in **administrator mode**
   >You will need administrator access on your computer.

   *Refer to step 7 for more guidance on which prompt to open.*

6. #### Navigate to your `dervet` folder.
   This is the location of the repository or downloaded folder on your local computer. We refer to this location as the
    "root directory"

7. #### Create Python environment
    We give the user 2 routes to create a python environment for python 3.8.13
   >Most Windows users have success with the Conda route.

    Each route results in a siloed python environment, but with different properties.
    Choose the conda OR pip route and stick to it. Commands are not interchangeable.
    >Please remember the route which created the python environment in order to activate it again later.
   > **You will need to activate the python environment to run the model, always.**

    **Conda Route - Recommended route for Windows OS**

    This route requires you to open Anaconda Prompt in step 5.

    Enter the following command:
    ```
    conda create -n dervet-venv python=3.8.13
    ```
    >The python version is specified, meaning conda does not have to be associated with a python 3.8.13.

    **Pip Route**

    If you have Python 3.8.13 installed directly on your computer, then we recommend trying this route.

    >This route lets you to open the prompt of your choice in step 5.

    Enter the following commands:
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv dervet-venv
    ```
    >The `pip` should be associated to the **python 3.8.13 installation**

8. #### Activate Python 3.8.13 environment
    **Conda Route**

    Enter the following command into anaconda prompt:
    ```
    conda activate dervet-venv
    ```

    **Pip Route**

    Enter the corresponding command into the open prompt:

    *On Linux/Mac*
    ```
    source dervet-venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *On Windows*
    ```
    "./dervet-venv/Scripts/activate"
    ```

9. #### Install project dependencies
    **Conda Route**

    Enter the following commands in anaconda prompt:
    ```
    pip install setuptools==52.0.0
    conda install conda-forge::blas=*=openblas --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt
    pip install numpy_financial==1.0.0
    pip install -e ./storagevet
    ```

    **Pip Route**

    Enter the following commands into the open prompt:
    ```
    pip install setuptools==52.0.0
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip install numpy_financial==1.0.0
    pip install -e ./storagevet
    ```

### Update Old Installation - For Windows

Are you a Beta Tester? Have an old graphical interface installed on your computer? Follow these instructions to replace
the `beta` version. We assume you installed the code previously with the "Happy Path" -- which assumes you installed
DER-VET on you local `C:\` drive.

1. #### Delete all folders in `C:\DERVET` except `C:\DERVET\DervetBackEnd`

2. #### Clone/download this repository onto your local computer as `dervet`.
    Place this new `dervet` folder in `C:\DERVET\DervetBackEnd`, thus replacing the existing one.

3. #### Clone/download the sub-repository, [StorageVET](https://github.com/epri-dev/StorageVET), onto your local computer into the root folder as `storagevet`.
    The root directory is `C:\DERVET\DervetBackEnd\dervet`, which was updated in the previous step.

4. #### Open Anaconda Prompt

5. #### Activate Python 3.8.13 environment
    ```
    conda activate "C:\DERVET\DervetBackEnd\"
    cd C:\DERVET\DervetBackEnd\dervet
    ```

6. #### Update project dependencies
    ```
    pip install setuptools==52.0.0
    conda install conda-forge::blas=*=openblas --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt
    pip install numpy_financial==1.0.0
    pip install -e ./storagevet
    ```

### Running Your First Case
Follow these steps to run DER-VET from the command prompt
1. ####  Open a shell/terminal/console/prompt and activate Python environment.
    Skip this step if your python environment is already active.
    >Refer to *New Installation* steps 5 and 8 OR to *Update Old Installation* step 5.

2. ####  Navigate to the root "dervet" folder.

2. ####  Enter the following into your command prompt:

    ```
    python run_DERVET.py Model_Parameters_Template_DER.csv
    ```

### Running the tests

1. #### Activate Python environment.
    > Skip this step if your python environment is already active. Refer to installation or update installation steps for activation instructions.

2. #### Enter the following into your terminal from inside the root "dervet" folder:
    ```
    python -m pytest test
    ```

## Deployment

To use this project as a dependency in your own, clone this repo directly into the root of your project.
Open terminal or command prompt from your project root, and input the following command:
```
pip install -e ./dervet
```

## Migrating DER-VET GUI project.json files

We have created a new folder titled "migrations" that is in the root "dervet" folder.
In this folder, we have provided a command-line Python script which will convert an existing version 1.1 DER-VET GUI project.json file into a version 1.2 DER-VET GUI project.json file. This script should be used with Python 3.2 or greater.

To view the usage statement for this script, open terminal or command prompt from your project root, and input the following command:
```
python migrations/migrate_project_dervet_GUI.py -h
```

The script accepts a single positional argument: the name of a folder which must contain a "project.json" file

## Versioning

see the [list of releases](https://github.com/epri-dev/DER-VET/releases)  on this repository.
This is version 1.2.2
